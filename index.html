<p>The main library function at this time centers around the concept of code Injectors.  To make it easier to grasp the idea behind them, these can perhaps be thought of as a form of <strong>closures which can also serve as modules</strong>.  Most of all Injectors propose some additional interesting properties to the idea of a mix-in.  For instance, they give your code the ability to capture its surrounding context and mix it into an indiscriminate target.  They make it possible to solve several general problems in some areas of OOP, overcoming traditional Ruby shortcomings with the GOF Decorator and Strategy Patterns, and enabling <strong>some new code patterns.</strong>  They instrument control over (code presence) the presence of injector code in targets with mechanisms involving injector ejection and directives.  They extend Ruby's mix-in and method resolution over and beyond what is possible with regular modules. Finally, they introduce the concept of Injector Versioning.  This is a feature which allows you to redefine parts of your program in local isolation and without it affecting others.  See Injector Versioning below.  </p>

<a id="basic-methods" class="anchor" href="#basic-methods" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a id="user-content-basic-methods" href="#basic-methods"></a>Basic Methods</h2>

<p>There are some basic methods to Jackbox.  These are just rudimentary helpers, which in effect are a form of syntax sugar for every day things.  But, behind their apparent sugar coating lie some powerful capabilities as shown the deeper you delve into Jackbox.  For more on them read the following sections, but their preliminary descriptions follow here:</p>

<h4>
<a id="decorate-sym-blk" class="anchor" href="#decorate-sym-blk" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a id="user-content-decorate-sym-blk" href="#decorate-sym-blk"></a>#decorate :sym, &amp;blk</h4>

<p>This method allows for decorations to be placed on a single method, be it an instance or class method without too much fuss. One important thing about #decorate is that it works like #define_method, but in addition, it also makes possible the use of Ruby's #super within the body of the decorator.  It really presents a better alternative and can be used instead of #alias_method_chain.</p>

<p>At the class level:</p>

<pre><code>class One
  decorate :foo do
    super() + 'decoration '                   # super available within decoration
  end
end

One.new.foo
#=&gt; foo decoration
</code></pre>

<p>Or, at the object level:</p>

<pre><code>one = One.new

one.decorate :foo do |arg|
  super() + arg                               # again the use of super is possible
end

one.foo('after')
#=&gt; foo decoration after
</code></pre>

<p>It also works like so:</p>

<pre><code>Object.decorate :inspect do
  puts super() + " is your object"
end

Object.new.inspect
#=&gt; #&lt;Object:0x00000101787e20&gt; is your object
</code></pre>

<h4>
<a id="with-obj-blk" class="anchor" href="#with-obj-blk" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a id="user-content-with-obj-blk" href="#with-obj-blk"></a>#with obj, &amp;blk</h4>

<p>There is also a new version of the #with construct.  The important thing to remember about #with is it has a primary context which is the object passed to it, and a secondary context which is the object you are making the call from.  This allows you to work <strong>with</strong> both contexts at the same time. The other important thing about #with is that it allows you to directly place definitions on and returns the same object you passed into it. </p>

<p>Here is some sample usage code:</p>

<pre><code>class One
  def foo(arg)
    'in One ' + arg
  end
end

class Two
  def faa(arg)
    'and in Two ' + arg
  end
  def meth
    with One.new do                           # context of One and Two available simultaneously!!!
      return foo faa 'with something'         
    end                                       # return object
  end
end

Two.new.meth
#=&gt; 'in One and in Two with something'
</code></pre>

<p>Use it to define function:</p>

<pre><code># internal facade for Marshal
with Object.new do

    @file_spec = [file, mode]               
    def dump hash
        File.open(*@file_spec) do |file|
            Marshal.dump( hash, file)
        end
    end
    def load hash
        File.open(*@file_spec) do |file|
            hash.merge!(Marshal.load( file ))
        end
    end

end
</code></pre>

<p>Use it with <strong>#decorate</strong> on singleton classes like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Dir

  with singleton_class do
    decorate :entries do |name='.', opts=nil| #:doc:
      super name, opts
    end
    decorate :new do |name, &amp;code| #:doc:
      FileUtils.mkpath name unless exists?(name)
      return Dir.open(name, &amp;code) if code
      Dir.open name
    end
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>We could say, this is simple syntax sugar.  It adds readability to some constructs.  It allows the creation of local or global procs using a more function-like syntax. But #lets, also opens the door to a new coding pattern termed Re-Classing.  See below.  The important thing about #lets is that it always defines some method/proc/lambda.  Here are some examples:</p>

<p>To define local functions/lambdas. Define symbols in local scope:</p>

<pre><code>def main
  lets bar =-&gt;(arg){ arg * arg }              # read as: lets set bar to lambda/proc 

  # later on ...

  var = bar[3]                                # bar is only available within #main
  #...
end                                                         
</code></pre>

<p>As a shortcut for define_method. Use it for short functional definitions:</p>

<pre><code>lets( :meth ){ |arg| arg * 2 }                # read as: lets define symbol :meth to be ....
meth(3)                                                         
# =&gt; 6 
</code></pre>

<p>Can be used to define a special values or pseudo-immutable strings:</p>

<pre><code>lets(:foo){ 3+Math::Pi }                      # read as: lets set :foo to value
lets(:faa){ 'some important string' }
</code></pre>

<a id="injectors" class="anchor" href="#injectors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a id="user-content-injectors" href="#injectors"></a>Injectors</h2>

<p>Injectors are the main tool in Jackbox at the time of this writing. These again are a form of mix-in that has properties of both a closure and a module.  They can also be thought of as an <strong>extended closure</strong> if you will or as a special kind of module if you want.  In the sections below we will discuss some of the methods available to you with Jackbox in connection with Injectors, as well as elaborate on some of the other properties of injectors. But, it is essential to understand there are some syntactical differences to Injectors with respect to regular modules.  We will show them first, with some examples: </p>

<p><strong>INJECTORS ARE DECLARED IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS:</strong></p>

<pre><code>injector :name

#  or...

Name = injector :name

# or even ...

facet :Name                                    # capitalized method, using alias #facet 
</code></pre>

<p>Their use and semantics are somewhat defined by the following snippet.  But, to fully understand their implications to your code, you have to understand the sections on injector versioning, their behavior under inheritance, and perhaps injector directives. </p>

<pre><code># somewhere in your code
include Injectors

injector :my_injector                         # define the injector 

my_injector do                     
  def bar                  
    :a_bar
  end
end

# later on...
widget.enrich my_injector                     # apply the injector
widget.bar
# =&gt; bar

# or...  

Mine = my_injector
class Target
  inject Mine                                 # apply the injector
end

Target.new.bar
# =&gt; bar

# etc ...
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a more interesting example:</p>

<pre><code>class ClosureExpose

    some_value = 'something'

    injector :capture do
        define_method :val do
            some_value
        end
    end
end

class SecondClass
    inject ClosureExpose.capture
end

# the result
SecondClass.new.val.should == 'something'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>INJECTORS HAVE PROLONGATIONS:</strong></p>

<pre><code>injector :my_injector

my_injector do                                # first prolongation

  def another_method
  end

end

# ...

my_injector do                                # another prolongation

  def yet_another_method
  end

end
</code></pre>

<h4>
<a id="injector-sym" class="anchor" href="#injector-sym" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a id="user-content-injector-sym" href="#injector-sym"></a>#injector :sym</h4>

<p>This is a global function.  It defines an object of type Injector with the name of symbol.  Use it when you want to generate an Injector object for later use.  The symbol can then be used as a handle to the injector whenever you need to prolong the injector by adding methods to it or apply it to another object. Additionally, this symbol plays a role in defining the injector's scope.  Injectors with capitalized names like :Function, :Style, etc have a global scope.  That is they are available throughout the program:</p>

<pre><code>class A
  injector :Function
end

class B
  include Function()
end

# This is perfectly valid with injectors  
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand Injectors with a lower case name are only available <strong>from</strong> the scope in which they were defined, like the following example shows:</p>

<pre><code>class AA
  injector :form
end

class BB
  include form                                # This genenerates and ERROR!                                 
end                         

class BB
  include AA.form
end

# This is perfectly valid with injectors  
</code></pre>

<p>For all this to happen Jackbox also introduces some additional Ruby constructs, namely the keywords #inject and #enrich.  These can be thought as simply new corollaries to #include and #extend. In fact they can be used interchangeably.  If you're working with injectors you may want to use them instead depending on context to make clear your intent.</p>

<h4>
<a id="includeinject-jack" class="anchor" href="#includeinject-jack" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a id="user-content-includeinject-jack" href="#includeinject-jack"></a>#include/inject *jack</h4>

<p>This method is analogous to ruby's #include but its use is reserved for Injectors.  The scope of this method is the same as the scope of #include, and its intended use like include's is for class definitions. Use it to "include" an Injector into a receiving class.  Takes multiple injectors.</p>

<h4>
<a id="extendenrich-jack" class="anchor" href="#extendenrich-jack" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a id="user-content-extendenrich-jack" href="#extendenrich-jack"></a>#extend/enrich *jack</h4>

<p>This method in turn is analogous to ruby's #extend. The scope of this method is also the same as that of #extend, and its intended use if for object definition.  Use it to extend the receiver of an injector.  Takes multiple injectors.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: Injector lookup follows the method and not the constant lookup algorithm.</strong></p>

<p>If you need to follow constant lookup, here is the code for that:</p>

<pre><code>Name = injector :sym ....                     # this also creates a hard tag (see below)
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a id="injector-versioning" class="anchor" href="#injector-versioning" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a id="user-content-injector-versioning" href="#injector-versioning"></a>Injector Versioning</h3>

<p>One of the most valuable properties of injectors is Injector Versioning.  Versioning is the term used to identify a feature in the code that produces an artifact of injection which contains a certain set of methods with their associated outputs, and represents a snapshot of that injector up until the point it's applied to an object.  From, that point on the object contains only that version of methods from that injector, and any subsequent overrides to those methods are only members of the "prolongation" of the injector and do not become part of the object of injection unless some form of re-injection occurs. Newer versions of an injector's methods only become part of newer objects or newer injections into existing targets.  With Jackbox Injector Versioning two different versions of the same code object can be running simultaneously. </p>

<p>We'll use some examples to illustrate the point.  This is how versioning occurs:</p>

<pre><code># injector declaration
#___________________
injector :my_injector do                                                            
  def bar
    :a_bar                                    # version bar.1
  end
  def foo
    # ...
  end
end

object1.enrich my_injector                    # apply the injector --first snapshot
object1.bar.should == :a_bar                  # pass the test

# injector prolongation
#__________________
my_injector do                                                                          
  def bar
    :some_larger_bar                          # version bar.2 ... re-defines bar
  end
  # ...
end

object2.enrich my_injector                    # apply the injector --second snapshot
object2.bar.should == :some_larger_bar

# result

object1.bar.should == :a_bar                  # bar.1 is still the one

###############################################
# First object has kept its preferred version #
###############################################
</code></pre>

<p>When re-injection occurs, and only then does the new version of the #bar method come into play. But the object remains unaffected otherwise, keeping its preferred version of methods.  The new version is available for further injections down the line and to newer client code.  Internal local-binding is preserved.  If re-injection is executed then clients of the previous version get updated with the newer one.  Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code># re-injection
#_________________
object1.enrich my_injector                    # re-injection --third snapshot

object1.bar.should == :some_larger_bar        # bar.2 now available

###############################################
# First object now has the updated version    #
###############################################
</code></pre>

<p>Re-injection on classes is a little bit trickier.  Why? Because class injection should be more pervasive --we don't necessarily want to be redefining a class at every step. To re-inject a class we must use the Strategy Pattern (see below) or use a private update.  See the sections below as well as the rspec files for more on this.   </p>

<p>Here is an example of Injector Versioning as it pertains to classes:</p>

<pre><code># injector declaration:
#___________________
injector :Versions do
  def meth arg                                # version meth.1
    arg ** arg
  end
end

class One
  inject Versions()                           # apply --snapshot
end

# injector prolongation:                              
#_________________
Versions do
  def meth arg1, arg2                         # version meth.2 ... redefines meth.1
    arg1 * arg2
  end
end

class Two
  inject Versions()                           # apply --snapshot
end

# result

Two.new.meth(2,4).should == 8                 # meth.2 
One.new.meth(3).should == 27                  # meth.1

##############################################
# Two different injector versions coexisting #
##############################################
</code></pre>

<p>To update the class, we then do the following:</p>

<pre><code>class One
  update Versions()                           # private call to #update
end

One.new.meth(2,4).should == 8                 # meth.2 
Two.new.meth(2,4).should == 8                 # meth.2 

##############################################
# class One is now updated to the latest     #
##############################################
</code></pre>

<p>The use of Tags is central to the concept of Injector Versioning.  Tagging happens in the following ways:</p>

<pre><code>Version1 = jack :function do
  def meth arg
    arg
  end
  def mith
    meth 2
  end
end

Version2 = function do
  def mith arg
    meth(arg) * meth(arg)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Version1 and Version2 are two different hard versions/tags/names of the same Injector.  There are also soft tags (see below).  </p>

<h3>
<a id="local-binding" class="anchor" href="#local-binding" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a id="user-content-local-binding" href="#local-binding"></a>Local Binding</h3>

<p>Before we move on, we also want to give some further treatment to injector local-binding.  That is, the binding of an injectors' methods is local to the prolongation/version in which they are located before the versioning occurs.  Here, is the code:</p>

<p><strong>Note: In the following examples we use the notion of version naming/tagging.  This allows you to tag different versions/prolongations of an Injector for later use.  Once a version is tagged it shouldn't be modified</strong></p>

<pre><code># injector declaration
#_____________________

Version1 = injector :functionality do
  def basic arg                               # version basic.1
    arg * 2
  end
end

o = Object.new.enrich Version1                # apply --snapshot (like above)
o.basic(1).should == 2                        # basic.1 

# injector prolongation
#_____________________

Version2 = functionality do
  def basic arg                               # version basic.2
    arg * 3                                   # specific use in compound.1
  end

  def compound                                # compound.1 
    basic(3) + 2                                      
  end
end

p = Object.new.enrich Version2                # apply --snapshot (like above)
p.basic(1).should == 3                        # basic.2 
p.compound.should == 11                       # compound.1 --bound locally to basic.2

o.basic(1).should == 2                        # basic.1 
o.compound.should == 11                       # compound.1 --bound locally to basic.2

<p>When you are working with an Injector in irb/pry it is often easier to just add methods to the injector without actually having to re-apply the injector to the the target to see the result.  This is just what the Jackbox method virtual cache is for among other things.  Here is what the code looks like:</p>

<pre><code># Facet definition
facet :SpecialMethods

class MyClass
  include SpecialMethods
end

obj = MyClass.new

SpecialMethods do
  def spm1                                    # spm1 is only defined in the virtual cache
    :result                                   # It is not actually part of the class yet!!
  end                                         # until this version/prolongation is applied
end

expect(obj.spm1).to eq(:result)               # yet my obj can use it --no problem
</code></pre>

<p>The key idea here is that the method virtual cache is the same for all versions of the Injector and all its applications.  If we redefine those methods they also get redefined for all versions.  To actually lock the method versions you must apply the Injector.</p>

<h4>
<a id="define_method-sym-blk" class="anchor" href="#define_method-sym-blk" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a id="user-content-define_method-sym-blk" href="#define_method-sym-blk"></a>#define_method sym, &amp;blk</h4>

<p>There is one more interesting property to method definition on Injectors however. The use of #define_method to re-define methods in any prolongation updates the entire injector and all its versions.  This also preserves a fundamental tenet of injectors: take some local context, enclose it, and use the injector to introduce it to some indiscriminate target, and additionally has some other uses as we'll see with in our description of patterns and injector composition.  </p>

<p>Here is an example of the difference with #define_method:</p>

<pre><code>facet :some_facet do
    def meth
      :meth
    end

    def foo_bar
        'a foo and a bar'
    end
end

class Client
    inject some_facet
end

Client.new.meth.should == :meth
Client.new.foo_bar.should == 'a foo and a bar'      


some_facet do                                  
    def meth                                    # New version

<p>Injector Versioning together with injector local-binding allow the metamorphosis of injectors to fit the particular purpose at hand and keeping those local modifications isolated from the rest of your program making your code to naturally evolve with your program. Use it as an alternative to refinements.</p>

<p>Injectors have the ability to speak about themselves.  Moreover injectors can speak about their members just like any module or class, and can also inject their receivers with these introspecting capabilities.  Every injected/enriched object or module/class can enumerate its injectors, and injectors can enumerate their members, and so forth.  </p>

<pre><code>injector :Function do
  def far
  end
  def close
  end
end

injector :Style do
    def pretty
    end
end

class Target
  inject Function(), Style()
end

# class ?

Function().class.should == Injector                 
Style().class.should == Injector

<p>Called with no arguments returns a list of injectors.  A call with a list of injector symbols however returns an array of actual Injector objects matching the names supplied in a LIFO fashion. An example use goes like this:</p>

<pre><code># injectors (in this target) ?

Target.injectors 
=&gt; [(#944120:|Function|), (#942460:|Style|)] 

# injectors :name ?

Target.injectors :Function
 =&gt; [(#944120:|Function|)]                    # same as #injectors.collect_by_name :name

Target.injectors :all                         # all injectors in this class's hierarchy 
                                              (see section on Inheritance)
</code></pre>

<p>The method also extends into a minuscule API: </p>

<pre><code>Target.injectors.by_name.should == [:Function, :Style] 
# ...

# aliased to :sym_list

Target.injectors.collect_by_name :name        # see above

# aliased to last_by_sym

<p>This method returns a trace of all the target hosted Injectors which is ordered based on the order in which they are created.  It includes tags and soft tags which can be specifically accessed thru the #tags method below.  Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code># create our injector
injector :HistorySample

# host it a couple of times
extend( HistorySample(), HistorySample() )

# expect the following
expect(injectors).to eq(HistorySample().history)
expect(HistorySample().history.size).to eq(2)
expect(HistorySample().history.last).to eql(HistorySample())
expect(HistorySample().history.last).to_not eq(HistorySample().spec)

# create a tag
HistorySampleTag = HistorySample()

expect(HistorySample().history.size).to eq(3)
expect(HistorySample().history.last).to equal(HistorySampleTag)
</code></pre>

<h4>
<a id="tags" class="anchor" href="#tags" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a id="user-content-tags" href="#tags"></a>#tags</h4>

<p>This method traces the tags only.  Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code># at this point from the above
expect(HistorySample().tags.size).to eq(1)

HistorySample(:tag) do
  # some definitions
end

# expect the following
expect(HistorySample().tags.size).to eq(2) 
</code></pre>

<p>Take a look at the Transformers Pattern below for an application of this and also the Jackbox blog at <a href="http://jackbox.us"></a><a href="http://jackbox.us">http://jackbox.us</a></p>

<p>The #pre method gets the previous element in the history. Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code># create the injector
injector :HistorySample

# create some history
extend HistorySample(), HistorySample()

# expect the following
expect(HistorySample().history.last.precedent).to equal(HistorySample().history.first)
</code></pre>

<p>The #pro method is a little different.  It gets the version from which a particular injector was generated. This may not necessarily be the precedent.  Take a look at the following code.</p>

<pre><code># create the injector
injector :Progample

# expect the following
expect(Progample().history).to be_empty
expect(Progample().progenitor).to equal(Progample().spec)

# create some history
extend Progample(), Progample()       

# expect the following

<a id="inheritance" class="anchor" href="#inheritance" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a id="user-content-inheritance" href="#inheritance"></a>Inheritance</h3>

<p>The behavior of Injectors under inheritance is partially specified by what follows:</p>

<pre><code>injector :j

class C
end
C.inject j {                                  #foo pre-defined at time of injection

    'foo'
  end
}
C.injectors.by_name.should == [:j]
C.new.injectors.by_name.should == [:j]

C.new.foo.should == 'foo'

# D inherits from C

class D &lt; C                                   # methods are inherited from j 
end
D.injectors.by_name.should == []
D.injectors(:all).by_name == [:j]

# New Objects
C.new.foo.should == 'foo'                                           
D.new.foo.should == 'foo'
</code></pre>

<p>More importantly though is the following:</p>

<pre><code>facet :player do                       
    def sound                               
        'Lets make some music'

</code></pre>

<p>From all this, the important thing to take is that injectors provide a sort of versioned inheritance.  The version inherits all of the pre-existing methods from the injector and freezes that function.  We can either Tag/Name it of simply include/extend into a target but the function is frozen at that time.  Tags cannot be modified or more clearly shouldn't be modified.  Classes retain the frozen version of the injector until the time an update is made.  Of course, there is always #define_method.   For more on all this see, the Rspec examples.</p>

<hr>

<p>But, this is the basic idea here.  An extended closure which can be used as a mix-in, prolonged to add function, and versioned and renamed to fit the purpose at hand. Using this approach Jackbox also goes on to solve the Decorator Pattern problem in the Ruby language.  </p>

<hr>

<h3>
<a id="the-gof-decorator-pattern" class="anchor" href="#the-gof-decorator-pattern" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a id="user-content-the-gof-decorator-pattern" href="#the-gof-decorator-pattern"></a>The GOF Decorator Pattern:</h3>

<p>Traditionally this is only partially solved in Ruby through PORO decorators or the use of modules.  However, there are the problems of loss of class identity for the former and the limitations on the times it can be re-applied to the same object for the latter. With Jackbox this is solved.  An injector used as a decorator does not confuse class identity for the receiver. Decorators are useful in several areas of OOP: presentation layers, stream processing, command processors to name a few.  </p>

<p>Here is the code for that:</p>

<pre><code>class Coffee
    def cost
        1.50
    end
end

injector :milk do
    def cost
        super() + 0.30
    end
end
injector :vanilla do
    def cost
        super() + 0.15
    end
end

cup = Coffee.new.enrich(milk).enrich(vanilla)
cup.should be_instance_of(Coffee)

cup.cost.should == 1.95
</code></pre>

<p>Furthermore, these same decorators can be then re-applied MULTIPLE TIMES to the same receiver.  This is something that is normally not possible with the regular Ruby base language.  Here are further examples:</p>

<pre><code>cup = Coffee.new.enrich(milk).enrich(vanilla).enrich(vanilla)

# or even...

cup = Coffee.new.enrich milk, vanilla, vanilla

cup.cost.should == 2.10
cup.should be_instance_of(Coffee)
cup.injectors.should == [:milk, :vanilla, :vanilla]
</code></pre>

<p>The functionality of Injectors can be removed from individual targets be them class targets or instance targets in various different ways.  This allows for whole 'classes' of functionality to be removed and made un-available and then available again at whim and under programer control.  </p>

<p>Here is an Injector removed after an #enrich to individual instance:</p>

<pre><code>class Coffee
    def cost
        1.00
    end
end
injector :milk do
    def cost
        super() + 0.50
    end
end

cup = Coffee.new.enrich(milk)
friends_cup = Coffee.new.enrich(milk)

cup.cost.should == 1.50
friends_cup.cost.should == 1.50

cup.eject :milk

cup.cost.should == 1.00

# friends cup didn't change price
friends_cup.cost.should == 1.50
</code></pre>

<p>Here it is removed after an #inject at the class level:</p>

<pre><code># create the injection
class Home
    injector :layout do
        def fractal
        end
    end
    inject layout
end
expect{Home.new.fractal}.to_not raise_error

# build
my_home = Home.new
friends = Home.new

# eject the code
class Home
    eject :layout
end

# the result
expect{my_home.fractal}.to raise_error
expect{friends.fractal}.to raise_error
expect{Home.new.fractal}.to raise_error
</code></pre>

<p>The code for these examples makes use of the #eject method which is also opens the door to some additional functionality provided by injectors.  See the Strategy Pattern just below this.  </p>

<a id="eject-sym" class="anchor" href="#eject-sym" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a id="user-content-eject-sym" href="#eject-sym"></a>#eject *sym</h4>

<p>This method ejects injector function from a single object or class.  It is in scope on any classes injected or enriched by an injector.  For other forms of injector withdrawal see the next sections as in addition to this method, there are other ways to control code presence in targets through the use of Injector Directives.  See below.  For more on this also see the rspec examples.</p>

<p>Injectors can be compared.  This allows for further introspection capabilities which could be used to determine if a certain piece of code possesses a block of capabilities, test if those are equal to some other component's capabilities, or test what the difference is.  It only follows that if injectors can be applied and withdrawn from any target we should be able to test for their similarities to other injectors.  Here is how equality is defined:</p>

<pre><code># Equality

E().should == E()
E().should_not == E().spec

E(:tag).should == E()
ETag1 = E()
ETag1.should == E()

extend E()
injectors.first.should == E()

E() do
    def foo                   # ** definition **
    end
end     

E().should == E()
ETag1.should_not == E()
injectors.first.should_not == E()
E(:tag).should == E()

E().should_not == F()
</code></pre>

<p>Here is how difference is defined:</p>

<pre><code># Difference

E().diff.should_not be_empty
# because
E().should_not == E().spec      # like above        


##################################
E().diff.should_not be_loaded
# because

E().diff.delta.should_not be_empty


##################################
E().diff(E()).should be_empty   
# because
E().should == E()               # like above

ETag2 = E()


##################################
E().diff(ETag2).should be_empty
ETag2.diff(E()).should be_empty
# because 
ETag2.should == E()                         # like above

<p>This description produces similar results to the one for injector ejection (see above) except that further injector method calls DO NOT raise an error.  They just quietly return nil. Here are a couple of different cases:</p>

<p>The case with multiple objects</p>

<p>Injectors that have been collapsed can at a later point then be reconstituted.  Here are a couple of cases:</p>

<p>Another pattern that Jackbox helps with is the GOF Strategy Pattern.  This is a pattern with changes the guts of an object as opposed to just changing its face. Traditional examples of this pattern use PORO component injection within constructors. </p>

<p>Here are a couple alternate implementations:</p>

<pre><code>class Coffee
    attr_reader :strategy

    def initialize
      @strategy = nil
    end
    def cost
        1.00
    end
  def brew
        @strategy = 'normal'
  end
end

cup = Coffee.new
cup.brew
cup.strategy.should == 'normal'


injector :sweedish do
    def brew
        @strategy = 'sweedish'
    end
end

cup = Coffee.new.enrich(sweedish)           # clobbers original strategy for this instance only!!
cup.brew
cup.strategy.should == ('sweedish')
</code></pre>

<p>But, with #eject it is possible to have an even more general alternate implementation. This time we completely replace the current strategy by actually ejecting it out of the class and then injecting a new one:</p>

<pre><code>class Tea &lt; Coffee  # Tea is a type of coffee!! ;~Q)
    injector :SpecialStrategy do
        def brew
            @strategy = 'special'
        end
    end
    inject SpecialStrategy()
end

cup = Tea.new
cup.brew
cup.strategy.should == 'special'

Tea.eject :SpecialStrategy

Tea.inject sweedish

cup.brew
cup.strategy.should == 'sweedish'

<p>There are also some additional coding patterns possible with Jackbox Injectors.  Although not part of the traditional GOF set these new patterns are only possible now thanks to languages like Ruby that permit the morphing of traditional forms into newer constructs.  Here are some new patterns: </p>

<p><strong>1) Late Decorator.-</strong> Another flow that also benefits from #define_method in an interesting way is the following:   </p>

<pre><code>class Widget
    def cost
        1
    end
end
w = Widget.new

injector :decorator

w.enrich decorator, decorator, decorator, decorator

# user input
bid = 3.5 

decorator do
    define_method :cost do                      # defines function on all injectors of the class
        super() + bid
    end
end

w.cost.should == 15
</code></pre>

<p>The actual injector function is late bound and defined only after some other data is available.</p>

<p><strong>2) The Super Pattern.-</strong> No.  This is not a superlative kind of pattern.  Simply, the use of #super can be harnessed into a pattern of controlled recursion, like in the following example: </p>

<pre><code>facet :Superb

Superb do
    def process string, additives, index
        str = string.gsub('o', additives.slice!(index))
        super(string, additives, index) + str rescue str
    end
    extend Superb(), Superb(), Superb()
end   

Superb().process( 'food ', 'aeiu', 0 ).should == 'fuud fiid feed faad '
Superb(:implode)                                 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>3) The Transformer Pattern.-</strong>  For a specific example of what can be accomplished using this workflow please refer to the rspec directory under the transformers spec.  Here is the basic flow:</p>

<pre><code>jack :Solution

Solution( :tag ) do
    def solution
        1
    end
end
Solution( :tag ) do
    def solution
        2
    end
end
Solution( :tag ) do
    def solution
        3
    end
end


class Client
    inject Solution()

    def self.solve
        Solution().tags.each { |e|
            update e 
            puts new.solution rescue nil
        }                              

        # or...

        solutions = Solution().tags.each
        begin
            update solutions.next
            puts solved = new().solution()
        end until solved
        solved
    end

end

Client.solve
</code></pre>

<p><strong>4) The Re-Classing Pattern.-</strong>  Our base method #lets has one more interesting use which allows for an alternative way to refine classes.  We have termed this Re-Classing.  Look at the following code:</p>

<pre><code># define injectors

StringExtensions = injector :StringExtensions do
  def to_s
        super + '++++'
    end
end


# Jackbox Reclassing

lets String do 
    include StringExtensions
end

assert( String('boo').to_s == 'boo++++' )

describe :String do
    it 'should pass' do

        String('boo').to_s.should == 'boo++++'

    end 
end
</code></pre>

<p>The important thing to remember here is that #String() is a method now. We can redefine it, name-space it, test for its presence, etc.  We can also use it to redefine the re-class's methods.  For more on this see, the rspec files and the Jackbox blog at <a href="http://jackbox.us"></a><a href="http://jackbox.us">http://jackbox.us</a>.              </p>

<p>Jackbox includes a couple of additional ancillary tools.  The first is an Abstract class base that prevents instantiation of the base class itself but not of its descendants.  The second is a persistent properties module named Prefs; it creates class/module/namespace level persistent properties.</p>

<p>With Abstract the code goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Vector
    extend Abstract
    def speed
        0
    end
    def direction
    end
end
expect{Vector.new}.to raise_error

class Velocity &lt; Vector
    def speed
        super + 35
    end
    def direction
        :north
    end
end

expect{Velocity.new}.to_not raise_error
Velocity.new.speed.should == 35
</code></pre>

<p>With Prefs you can add persistent properties to a class.  These properties persist even through program termination. Here is the example code:</p>

<pre><code>module Jester
    extend Prefs

    pref :value =&gt; 10
end

Jester.value.should == 10
Jester.value = 3
Jester.value.should == 3
Jester.reset :value
Jester.value.should == 10 
</code></pre>

<p>There is also command line utility called <strong>jackup</strong> that simply allows users to bring their projects into a <em>"Jackbox level"</em>.  It inserts the right references and turns the targeted project into a bundler gem if it isn't already one also adding a couple of rake tasks.</p>
