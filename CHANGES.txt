0.9.5.9  RC1

. Added a spec for Injector behavior under Inheritance
. Fixed problem with same method name object level class ejection
. Changed the injector namespace resolution to be more consistent
  . all injectors accessible from the object they were defined
  . top level injectors still accessible at the top
  . Object level injectors accessible everywhere
. Fixed problem found with late code un-evaluation for blocks called on include/extend/update
. Fixed problems found with injections on class instances
  . injectors are now reported in this order: Class instance first, instances of THE class second
  . class instance injectors don't get include/reported on instances of the class
  . ejection on the Class instance now works normally
. Added Name Spacing spec to the set
  . injectors with caps are always part of the global name space
  . the rest of injectors are in scope where they are defined
  . can still be made follow constant lookup
. Finished spec-out for injector tagging
  . Version Tagging/Naming now has a formal spec as part of name spacing
  . tags are frozen versions of an injector
. Redefined #ancestors to more correctly reflect the actual ancestor chain
  . the only thing left off are the injectors subject to :implosion
  . the :implosion is marked on the individual injectors
. Relocated the ancestors examples to the inheritance spec
. Added a couple of methods relating to injector versions
  . defined history/versions method
  . defined #precedent method
. Added the concept of soft tags
  . they serve to define a new coding pattern employing the idea of iterative injection 
  . they simultaneously create a method :name_ in the callers namespace
. Changed #with method to module_eval on Modules
  . fixed issue with referring #define_method to caller
  . if it's not in the object for the with it errors out
. Added transformers example(Working Beautifully)
. Changed #injectors reflection api to have more flexibility 
  . injectors :name gets the last injector by that name
  . injectors :name, :name gets those last injectors
  . injectors simply gets all injectors
. Finalized injectors.#... sub object model api
  . Name.injectors == [j,......]
  . Name.injectors.by_name == [:name, ......]
    . Name.injectors.sym_list == [:name, ......]
  . Name.injectors.collect_by_name(:name) == [j,......]  (default method)
    . Name.injectors.all_by_sym(:name) == [j,......]  (default method)
    . same as Name.injectors :name
  . Name.injectors.find_by_name(:name) == j (the last injector by name)
    . Name.injectors.pick_by_sym(:name) == j (the last injector by name)
  . Name.injectors.#Enumerable...
. Added a way to refers to tags on ancestor introspection( not displaying under pry only irb )
. Changed the show method to a more compact version
. Reworked the inheritance and ancestor chain examples
. Added inheritance spec examples to show ancestor search
. Added examples into the name spacing spec to show Tags on ancestor chains
. Fixed an issue existing only on Ruby 1.9 with define method at the top level
. Cleaned code and examples
. Changed #to_s/#inspect/#show display routines including for tags
. Started work on optimizations
. Added sym_for object method to Module class
. Solved automatic tag tracing
. Override module_eval to work with functor(&code)
  . added functor definition
. Added the notion of equality to Injectors
. Reworked examples to:
  . comply with new equality operators
  . accommodate hard tags
. Added the tags method
. Polished the history method
. Started exploration on using Weak References for Injectors
. Fixed complete Injector implosion from leaving the Injector name obliterated
. Refactored some code
. Examples to test history
. Renamed and refactored other examples
. Added examples to the Patterns spec
. With statement streamlined and rescued
. Combined history and tags
  . ensure all tags are accounted for before
  . ensuring history returns correct results
. Finished with equality
. Broke out injector spec into smaller files:
  . Directives
  . Introspection
. Added examples of new workflows and patterns
. Cleaned up tagging and other examples
. Updated Ruby, gems, and tested compatibility
  . compatible with the latest and greatest
ALL SPECS PASSING
  

0.9.5.8
  
  . More seamless integration with the Ruby base
  
  . Injectors now work at the top level
    . extend/enrich to work at the top level
    . include/inject also work at the top level

    Previously injection/enrichment were faltering at the top level.  Now they 
    work the same way all the way through.
    
  . Ancestors are reported the right way now
    . ejected injectors do not show in the ancestors chain
    . works both on class/singleton_class ancestors calls
    
  . Added Injector#show, #to_s, #inspect implementations 
  . Changed Injectors name spacing.  Now contained within Jackbox.
  . Added some specs and reworked others.
  . Cleaned up some code.
