0.9.5.8
  
  . More seamless integration with the Ruby base
  
  . Injectors now work at the top level
    . extend/enrich to work at the top level
    . include/inject also work at the top level

    Previously injection/enrichment were faltering at the top level.  Now they 
    work the same way all the way through.
    
  . Ancestors are reported the right way now
    . ejected injectors do not show in the ancestors chain
    . works both on class/singleton_class ancestors calls
    
  . Added Injector#show, #to_s, #inspect implementations 
  
  . Changed Injectors name spacing.  Now contained within Jackbox.
  
  . Added some specs and reworked others.
  
  . Cleaned up some code.

    Issues:

      Top level:
      .
